# SPA 
A technology that loads a single web page and performs updates to the DOM on this single web page based on user interaction with this web page in known as a SPA.

 For a component to render something on the page, it needs to return it as one or more JSX elements.

 Data flow is one-directional which means that a parent component can send the same data to one or more child components, but it's not possible to communicate from the child components back to the parent component using props.     
 
 When two components communicate with each other, the component sending the props data is known as the parent and the one receiving the data is known as the child.
