# Programming Paradigm

## Functional Programming
> The function and data are seperately written.
```javascript
// code yourself
```


## Object-Oreinted Programming
> The function and data are collectively written within an object.


## Recursion
> the functions that calls itself is known as recursive function.

## Scope
> determines which part of the code are accessible and which are not. `Global Scope` & `Local Scope` 
> Variables created within the local scope cannot be read by code at the global scope level. They are accessible only to functions located within the local scope.  

* `var`:
* `let`:
* `const`:

**When you use let and const to declare a variable, it is scoped to the block - even within if statements and loops, like the for or while loops. Therefore, the quantity variable you create will only exist within the for loop.**
