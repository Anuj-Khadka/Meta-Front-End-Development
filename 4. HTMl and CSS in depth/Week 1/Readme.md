that ensures that the data entered by
the user in a form is valid
and conforms to rules defined by the developer. there are two types of validation: 
* `Client-Side Validation`: it is done in the frontend of the website when the user starts filling their data in the form. For example, if the user doesn't enter the correct email, they will get a message of invalid email. This can be done using specific input type.
* `Server-side Validation`: it is done in the backend of the website to prevent from malicious data entry and code bleach. It can perform more complex checks like database checks and requirements.
